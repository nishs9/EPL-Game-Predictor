# EPL Game Predictor

This is a a little side project I am currently working on. My overarching goal is to try and develop a model that can be used to predict the results of EPL matches. However, I am not sure what the end product will be. At the moment, I am solely focusing on creating the model and doing some preliminary testing. Any updates or changes to the project will be updated here.

## Data Sources

At the moment, I am using data from: https://www.football-data.co.uk/data.php

Any other data sources or datasets that I utilize will be added in this section as and when that happens
